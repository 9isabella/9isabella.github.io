"# 9isabella.github.io" 

To the best of my knowledge, all aspects of this project have been completed. I did not work with anyone on the assignment. I've likely spent about five hours working on this, although most of that time was spent trying to figure out file permissions and understand how to use git and visual studio code. Although I did complete all aspects of the assignment, I did not get to do all the styling I would have liked to do (it's not very pretty yet!), so I plan on working on that more in the future.
